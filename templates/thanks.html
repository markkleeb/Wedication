                        Thanks so much for sharing in our special day! We have so many people to thank for making this wedding the best day of our lives. First and foremost, Sandy and Neil Gross were the best wedding planners we could ask for. We couldn't have had more generous and loving people to support our crazy ideas and go along with them. Donna and Maria Kleback also helped us with decorations and planning.
                    </p>

                        Some other family members also helped out - Mark Stern cut the logs that held the placecards, and Meghan Weale did all of the caligraphy and cocktail menu designs. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">Rabbi Robbie Weiner of <a href="http://www.bethamtemple.org/">Beth Am Temple</a> in Yorktown Heights officiated the ceremony. Carol Weale, Mark's aunt, read the opening reading. Brian Gross and Rebecca Pearlman read the Seven Blessings.

                        Our friend <a href="https://wharfer.bandcamp.com/">Kyle Wall</a> played piano at the ceremony. Kyle and Mark met at Penn State back in 2005 and we loved his solo project Wharfer and thought he'd be perfect for the pre-ceremony music.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                        Our DJ was <a href="http://monamieeventsnyc.com/">Mona Dehghan</a> who played the best goddamn wedding music. She had seven versions of the hora for us to choose from. Hire her for your wedding!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you made it to the afterparty, you were lucky enough to listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSyT9NhUpg">DJ Marty McSorley</a> while eating chicken fingers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">During cocktail hour we had two musicians, <a href="http://www.geoffhanssler.com/">Geoff Hanssler</a> and <a href="http://www.neilsveri.com/">Neil Sveri</a>, playing modular synths. Once we get our video footage back we'll post some of the performance, so check back!
</p>
<p class="lead">We hired <a href="https://www.alexandrapinel.com/">Alexandra Pinel</a> to help two clumsy idiots do a choreographed dance. We think she did a pretty good job!

                        This is the third time we've brought the Giffinator to a wedding, and we had a lot of contributions from the guests of this wedding! The <a href="http://www.giffinator.com/gif/3821">"city lights"</a> and <a href="http://www.giffinator.com/gif/3652">"cat cafe"</a> scenes were by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mariakleeb/">Maria Kleback</a>.

    <br>
    <br>
The Chuppah was built with the spare parts of the <a href="https://pluspool.org/">+Pool</a> project that Mark worked on with <a href="http://floating.pt/">Floating Point</a> and <a href="https://beamcenter.org/">Beam Center</a>. Each post of the Chuppah is connected to a DMX light controller, and the colors and patterns react to the sound in the room.

<a href="http://work.jackkalish.com/">Jack Kalish</a> designed the software for the Chuppah. It was built in <a href="https://openframeworks.cc/">OpenFrameWorks</a>.
<br>

    The canopy of the Chuppah was the wedding dress of Estelle Feinman, Stephanie's grandmother. It was modified by Susan at <a href="http://instagram.com/theweddingdresser_brooklyn">The Wedding Dresser</a></p>


<h3 class="faq">The Texting Robot</h3>
<p>
<img src="/static/img/robot.jpg" width="350px">
    </p>
<p class="lead">The wedding robot was inspired by a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/04/wedding-at-scale-how-i-used-twilio-python-and-google-to-automate-my-wedding.html">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/SeekTom">Thomas Curtis</a>. It uses the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> platform to send text messages. The code is written in Python and reads and writes all of the info to a Google Spreadsheet. This allowed us to easily see which guests had responded and what they wanted to eat. </p>

<h3 class="faq">The Artists</h3>
<p>
<img src="/static/img/uphues.JPG" width="300px">
</p>
<p class="lead">Mark and Stephanie wanted to include their favorite Brooklyn artists into elements of the wedding. <a href="https://chrisuphues.com/">Chris Uphues</a> did the art for all of the table centerpieces, as well as Stephanie's shoes.
<br>
<br>
Rob Coradetti, or <a href="https://killeracid.com/">Killer Acid</a>, is the artist who made the enamel pins that Mark and his comrades wore on their lapels.

<h3 class="faq">Photographers and Videographers</h3>
<p class="lead">Our photographers were <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_markows/">The Markows</a>. Julianne and Steve are so talented and we were lucky to have them shooting our special day.
