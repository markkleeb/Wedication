# Wedication

This is a website and scripts I used to automate sending out wedding invitations via SMS. It was cloned from:

https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/04/wedding-at-scale-how-i-used-twilio-python-and-google-to-automate-my-wedding.html

This project uses python to send and receive SMS messages, and writes the responses to a Google spreadsheet using the Google Docs API. All of the SMS was handled with the Twilio API.
